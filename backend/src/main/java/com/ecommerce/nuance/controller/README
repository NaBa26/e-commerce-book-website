The Controller is something where the orders and requests will come from the client to the server.
We are using REST API so we will use the REST Controller.
We have to create different methods specific to what will the web service calls when the user sends a request.
The logic will be written inside the implementation class.
Controller class will have the method names the same as they are in the service class.
@RequestMapping is used to give the specify the base URL path.
